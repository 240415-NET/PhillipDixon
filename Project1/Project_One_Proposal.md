My proposal is to create a board game collection and play tracking app.

The core feaures of the app will be:
- allow users to create a login
- allow users to enter the games they own
- allow users to enter the names of all the players in their gaming group. Each player will then be tracked separately.
- allow users to indicate how often they have played a given game.
- Allow users to indicate which other players they played with.

Because the app will be meant for a group of people who know each other well, the app will not be password protected. 
Anyone will have the ability to create a unique user (to better enable tracking whom you played a given game with), 
but will have some basic checks to help prevent player duplication. The ability to edit a player profile will exist as well. 




The application should be a C# Console Application
The application should build and run
The application should interact with users, and provide some console UI
The application should allow for multiple users to log in and persist their data
The application should demonstrate good input validation
The application should persist data to a SQL Server DB
The application should communicate to DB via ADO.NET or Entity Framework Core
The application should have unit tests
Nice to Have
n-tier architecture
dependency injection
The application should log errors and system events to a file or a DB table
Basic user authentication and authorization (admins vs normal users with passwords)
